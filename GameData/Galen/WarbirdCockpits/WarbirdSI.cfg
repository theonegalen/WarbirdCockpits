		@description = A cockpit from the early days of aviation, when engines were basically fans driven by hundreds of tiny explosions. Minimally pressurized and without all that heavy heat shielding. Warranty void if exposed to vacuum, high temperatures or used for any sort of lithobreaking. Instruments now in SI measurements!
